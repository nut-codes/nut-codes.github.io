Nut Codes let apps and websites exchange data about the nutritional content of foods, recipes, and meals using a short URL-like piece of text, which can also be displayed or printed as a QR code for easy scanning with a smartphone. 

Existing food diary apps let you look up many packaged foods and chain-restaurant meals by brand name, or by scanning a barcode. But for home-cooked meals or mom-and-pop restaurant menus, you're unlikely to be able to look up the information you need. 

Meanwhile, many recipe apps have a feature that calculates nutrition information automatically, but getting that information into your food diary app is often a hassle. With Nut Codes, a recipe app can include a button, link, or QR code to automatically load the data into a compatible food diary app. Restaurants can also print a Nut Code for each item in their menu. And printed cookbooks can likewise include scannable codes with their recipes. 

Finally, because Nut Codes aren't looked up in a central database, your food choices can remain private.
