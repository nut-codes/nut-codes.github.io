## Q: Are there any example implementations?

A: There is [an implementation written in Swift](https://github.com/nut-codes/swift) that supports encoding and decoding of Nut Macro codes. Contributions of implementations in additional languages are welcome. 

## Q: What's the plan for support for micronutrients?

A: Micronutrients are a bit more complicated to encode, since the amounts vary by many orders of magnitude. It also isn't yet clear if there is demand for a scheme like Nut Codes, so I'm releasing the macro-only code as a sort of MVP (minimum viable product).
